# Final Project

This is a language translator that will translate your text as well as speak the translation in order to aid in your recital.

## Key Features


* **This app features the following:
*Translation support for 90 different language combinations
*The ability to copy the translation so you may paste into the word processor of your choice.
*The ability to read the translation back to the user and the ability to adjust the rate of playback to better aid you in your own respective recital.

## App function

* User selects which language(s) for both input and output. The user can then type into the text placeholder, on the left, the wording they would like to have translated. Once input is complete, the user would click the translate text button to have the text translated to their target language and text will be displayed on the right text placeholder. While the API is fetching and parsing the data, the user will see the text, "Translating...".

* User has the option to have the translated text cited back to them, which allows for better understanding and aids in the user's respective recital of the translation. In order to do so, the user would push the play icon on the respective language they would like to hear back.

* User has the option to adjust the rate at which they would like to hear the translation cited back to them. The rate slider allows for the user to opt for slow speech when slid to the left and rapid speech as the slider is slid to the right.

* User can copy the translation using the copy button to allow for pasting into a word processor of their choice for saving and printing.
